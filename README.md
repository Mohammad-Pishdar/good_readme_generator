# Good Readme Generator

  ## Description
  When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README. This command line application dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

  ## Installation

  All you need to do is to run `npm install` in the command line in order to install the required dependencies for this app on your system. In order to run this app please type and execute `node index.js` in the command line.

  ## Usage

  This app could be used to generate nicely formatted and professional looking readme files for your projects on GitHub using markdown. You run the app in your system's command line by typing node index.js and it will then ask you a series of questions to create an already formatted nice-looking README.md file for your project using your inputs as the user. It will include a main title, with all the sub-headings for 'Description', a clickable 'Table of contents', 'Installation', 'Usage', 'License', 'Contributing', 'Tests' and 'Questions' sections. It will also shows a badge with a link to the type of license you chose for your project at the top of your README.md file as a badge. You can watch a video walkthrough of how to use this app [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16p5e1HvHKgzLqPI-qcGbYMsMVs02XTMw/view).
